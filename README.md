# AI Presentation Generator

Welcome to the AI Presentation Generator! This Python project leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 to automatically generate presentations based on a single word. With just a few simple steps, you can create engaging and informative presentations without the hassle of manual content creation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Presentation Generator on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher

    ```
   
### Configuration

1. Open the getResponse.py file in a text editor of your choice.

2. Locate the following line:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ```
   
3. Replace "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Running the generator

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the createPresentation.py file:
